This application was created so that users can use it to learn more about our daily weather and can look forward to the next weeks weather list due to its design being a fun and interesting source.
We can learn alot from this application 
Kids can learn more about weather and can get more knowledge from whatching the changes in the daily hours

The application starts off with an lock screen namly the splash screen and go through where a user can click a button so then it will switch to a different screen and that will be the home screen where the weather is layed out and it shows what the weather looks like for the upcomming week
lastly we have a the Detailed View of the weather following up on the different percentages or degrees that goes through the week
also showing users the main points 
The min and max values of the weather will also be shown and there will also be a button where a user can navigate back to Weather layout


Now we can take a look at some snippet of pseudocodes that i created while developing the app.
